# **Zomato Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python**  

This project explores restaurant data from Zomato, focusing on South India. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers key trends related to restaurant distribution, customer preferences, and service availability. Using Python and data visualization techniques, the analysis provides insights that can help businesses optimize their strategies in the food industry.  

## **Project Overview**  
The goal of this project is to analyze Zomatoâ€™s restaurant dataset and extract meaningful insights. Key activities include:  

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure accurate analysis.  
- **Feature engineering** to refine key variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in restaurant types, cuisine preferences, pricing, and customer ratings.  

## **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization to identify patterns and trends.  
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, focusing on South Indian restaurant data.  

## **Key Steps**  

### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., address, phone numbers, URLs).  
- Handled missing values, especially in the rating column, by replacing them with the average rating.  
- Converted cost data into numerical format for better analysis.  
- Dropped duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- Created new categorical columns for better segmentation.  
- Standardized location names and restaurant types for consistency.  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
Performed in-depth analysis to uncover key insights:  

#### **Restaurant Distribution by Location**  
- BTM has the highest number of restaurants, while Airport Nagar, St. Marks Road, and Commercial Street have the lowest.  

#### **Online Ordering and Table Booking Trends**  
- Most restaurants provide online ordering, but table booking is less common.  
- Restaurants that offer both online ordering and table booking tend to receive higher ratings.  
- BTM leads in online service availability, while Shanti Nagar, Shivaji Nagar, and Commercial Street have fewer online service options.  

#### **Popular Restaurant Types and Ratings**  
- Pubs and bars maintain a strong presence, with an average rating of 4.3.   

#### **Cuisine Preferences**  
- North Indian, Chinese, and South Indian cuisines are the most popular among customers.  

## **Business Insights and Impact**  
This analysis helps understand:  
- **Customer Preferences**: The most sought-after cuisines and restaurant types.  
- **Service Optimization**: How online ordering and table booking impact restaurant ratings.  
- **Location-Based Demand**: Areas with the highest and lowest restaurant density.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project provides valuable insights into the restaurant landscape in South India, highlighting customer behavior and restaurant trends.
